# model
seq2seq
    encoder
        GNN: accept a super graph of multi PDGs.
    decoder
        GNN: accept a super graph of multi PDGs
    connect:
        decoder accepts hidden states of all changed nodes in encoder
    param_sharing:
        encoder & decoder shares parameters of:
            1. node & edge feature transformation matrix weights
            2. aggregation matrix weights
            3. attention weights
